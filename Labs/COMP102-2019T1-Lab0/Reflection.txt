Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

The NameTagPrinter program is pretty simple, but it still contains quite a lot of
different kinds of instructions. Even though we haven't covered them all in
lectures yet, you should still be able to make educated guesses about what they
mean.

1. Can you identify two different kinds of instructions in the code?

2. The "text version" of the name tag probably didn't work very well when you
changed the name.  Why? What could you do about it?


The MazeMouse puzzle is trickier than it first looks, like lots of programming
tasks.

1. What process did you go through to try to solve the puzzle?

2. If you were trying to be systematic in checking that someone else's proposal
would work on any maze, how would you go about it?
