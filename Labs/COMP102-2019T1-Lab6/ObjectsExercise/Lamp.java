/** A Lamp object represents a table lamp on the graphics pane. A lamp consists of a colored bulb and a stem.
 *   It remembers its current position, its color and whether it is on or off.
 *   Its initial position and its color are set when it is constructed.
 *   The diameter of a bulb should be 80.
 *   The height of the stem should be 80.
 *   The width of the stem should be 20.
 *   It has three methods:
 *     draw(),        which draws the lamp at its current position.
 *     onBulb(x,y),   which reports whether the point(x,y) is on the bulb.
 *     onStem(x,y),   which reports whether the point(x,y) is on the stem.
 *     turnOff(),     which turns the light off.
 *     changeColor(), which turns the light on if it is off; changes its color to a random bright colour if it is already on.
