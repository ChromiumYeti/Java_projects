Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

0. List which methods of the BalloonGame you completed. (This will help the marker!)

restartGame()
doMouse()
findBalloonOn()
findTouching()
calculateScore()
main()

Other helper methods I used
redisplay()
balloonCount()

1. Why do you need fields in the MiniPaint program? Explain why couldn't you use local variables in the methods.

Fields were helpful in this case as there was information needed and called on by multiple methods and required the data to be stored relatively long term.

2. What were the design problems you had when working on MiniPaint and BalloonGame? What bits were hard to get right?

I didn't come across too many problems in the MiniPaint program aside from trying getting ArrayList conversion to Array for the Polygon, and a frustration on creating shapes from any direction was primarily a result of a misplaced 'else if' instead of an 'if' statement. The ArrayList conversion I had issues with not being able to set up the right type of array output for it and could not get it working in time.

With the BalloonGame, I had odd issues with calculating the score correctly as it would only select one balloon (presumably the first) and only account increases from that and no other balloon. Since I was not able to get this working correctly, I unfortunately could not test the other methods that relied on that data.
