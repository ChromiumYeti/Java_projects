Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. Describe some of the errors that you made while working on this assignment. 
Were any of them difficult to debug?

2. If an image was standard SVGA size (800x600), how big would a ppm file of the
image be, given that each character in the file (including the spaces) requires
1 byte? How much worse is this than a typical jpg or png file of the same
number of pixels? (you may need to go and find some typical images that are
about 800x600 pixels).
