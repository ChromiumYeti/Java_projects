/**
 *  Lets a player play a simple Solitaire dominoes game.
 *  Dominoes are rectangular tiles with two numbers from 0 to 6 on
 *  them (shown with dots).
 *  The player has a "hand" which can contain up to six dominoes.
 *  They can reorder the dominoes in their hand, they can place dominoes
 *  from their hand onto the table, and they can pick up more dominoes from
 *  a bag to fill the gaps in their "hand".
 *  The core and completion do not involve any of the matching and scoring
 *  of real dominoes games. 
 *
 *  PROGRAM DESIGN
 *  The dominoes are represented by objects of the Domino class.
 *  The Domino constructor will construct a new, random domino.
 *  Dominos have a draw(double x, double y) method that will draw the
 *  Domino on the graphics pane at the specified position.
 *  
 *  The program has two key fields:
 *    hand:  an array that can hold 6 Dominos. 
 *    table: an ArrayList of the Dominos that have been placed on the table.
 *    
 *  The hand should be displayed near the top of the Graphics pane with a
 *   rectangular border and each domino drawn at its place in the hand.
 *  Empty spaces in the hand should be represented by nulls and displayed as empty.
 *
 *  The user can select a position on the hand using the mouse.
 *  The selected domino (or empty space) should be highlighted with
 *  a border around it.
 *  
 *  The user can use the "Left" or "Right" button to move the selected domino
 *  (or the space) to the left or the right, in which case the domino is
 *  swapped with the contents of the adjacent position in the hand.
 *  If the selected position contains a domino, the user
 *  can use the "Place" button to move the selected domino to the table.
 *  
 *  If there are any empty positions on the hand, the user can use the
 *  "Pickup" button to get a new (random) domino which will be added to
 *  the hand at the leftmost empty position.
 *
 *  The table is represented by an ArrayList of dominos.
 *  At the beginning of the game the table should be empty.
 *  Dominos should be added to the end of the table.
 *  The table should be displayed in rows at the top of the graphics pane.
