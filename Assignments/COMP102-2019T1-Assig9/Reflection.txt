Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.

Off-by-one errors occur when instances of using "<=" instead of "<" for comparing things or when the sequence starts at 0 instead of 1, typically found in iterative loops. Minor errors can result in the ranges in iterative loops falling just outside or falling short of the expected.

2. Both DominoGame and EarthquakeAnalyser used another class that was written
for you. This saved you writing some code, but also constrained you to write
the program in a particular way. Discuss advantages and disadvantages you found
when having a predefined class that you had to use as part of your program.

Advantages of predefined classes developed in this way is that you can have a better orgnisation of your methods in the form of a constructor to make instances of objects. This makes it easier to call up the objects when you need to and provide and overall cleaner code structure. A couple of disadvantages is that there aren't easy ways to return values if needed and perhaps efficiency concerns if the objects are more complex.s
