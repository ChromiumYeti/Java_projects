/** Frog
 *  A new frog starts at the given position, with the given direction, and 
 *     has either a "light" or "dark" shade.
 *  Frogs can turn in 4 directions: left, right, up, and down. 
 *  Frogs move around at a constant speed in an arena with an enclosing wall,
 *     following its direction, until it hits a wall. In which case it stops moving.
 *  Frog can grow in size, and (for the completion) can also shrink by resetting their size
 *      to the orginal value.
 *
 *  The walls of the arena are determined by the constants:
 *    FrogGame.TOP_WALL, FrogGame.BOT_WALL, FrogGame.LEFT_WALL and FrogGame.RIGHT_WALL
