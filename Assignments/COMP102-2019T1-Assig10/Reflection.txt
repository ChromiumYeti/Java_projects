Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Some of the methods in the ImageProcessor program could be done in two
different ways: "in-place" (only using the array containing the image), or
using a temporary array to store the image as it was being processed. Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. 

2.This was the last assignment.  Think back to the beginning of the
course and what you knew at that point, and then list some of the new skills
and understanding that you believe that you have gained during this course.

[For some of you who are still finding the course difficult, you could
try doing some of the early assignments again; you may find them an awful lot
easier the second time round, demonstrating that you have learned stuff!]
