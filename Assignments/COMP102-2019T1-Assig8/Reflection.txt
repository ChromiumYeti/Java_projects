Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. List which methods of the WaveformAnalyser you completed.

2. When working with ArrayLists, many errors occur at the boundaries of the
list. Discuss some of the errors you had to deal with in your code. Did the
errors involve the ends of the list?

3. The program used one pixel width of the window for each value in the
waveform. If the waveform were from a real WAV file, it would have much more
data than would fit on the window. How might you change the program to deal
with that?
